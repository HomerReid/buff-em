BUFF-EM is a free open-source software suite that implements
the volume-integral-equation (VIE) formulation of computational
electromagnetism using SWG basis functions.

BUFF-EM is closely related to SCUFF-EM, and it depends on many
of the support libraries distributed with that package.

BUFF-EM stands for 

 BUlk Field Formulation of ElectroMagnetism
