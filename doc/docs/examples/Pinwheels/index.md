# Thermal self-rotation of a QED pinwheel

In this example we consider a warm chiral particle---a
**QED pinwheel**---in a cold environment. The thermal
radiation from the pinwheel carries away not only
energy but also angular momentum, forcing the pinwheel
to begin to rotate in the opposite direction to 
conserve angular momentum. This is the phenomenon of 
*thermal self-rotation*, and we will use [[buff-neq]]
to predict the angular acceleration on a variety of
pinwheels in an effort to identify the maximally
self-rotating design.
