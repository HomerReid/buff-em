# Thermal self-propulsion of a photon torpedo

In this example we consider a warm asymmetric particle---a
**photon torpedo**---in a cold environment. The thermal
radiation from the particle carries away not only
energy but also linear momentum, forcing the particle
to recoil in the opposite direction by conservation of
momentum. This is the phenomenon of *thermal self-propulsion*, 
and we will use [[buff-neq]] to predict the 
acceleration of a variety of torpedo designs in an 
effort to identify the maximally self-propelling
configuration.
